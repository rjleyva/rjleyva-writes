Hi everyone — it's RJ. As someone who consults full-time while learning development on my own, I spend a lot of time navigating an ecosystem that never really stands still. New frameworks, libraries, and patterns show up constantly, each promising better performance, cleaner abstractions, or faster delivery.

Over time, I’ve learned that progress doesn’t come from chasing all of them. It comes from knowing when to pause, when to learn, and when to stick with fundamentals.

## Why I’m Selective About New Frameworks

New frameworks are attractive for obvious reasons. They often look cleaner, more expressive, and more capable than what came before. It’s easy to believe that adopting the latest tool will unlock a step-change in productivity or understanding.

I’ve felt that pull many times. But I’ve also learned to slow down and ask a few practical questions before committing:

- What real problem does this solve that my current tools don’t?
- Is this addressing complexity I actually have, or complexity I imagine I’ll have?
- Does this fit the project I’m working on right now?

Those questions have helped me avoid learning for novelty’s sake. Instead of treating learning as a race to keep up, I try to treat it as an investment—one that should compound over time, not reset every few months.

## Learning the Patterns Beneath the Syntax

When I do decide to learn something new, the early phase is almost always uncomfortable. The syntax feels unfamiliar. The patterns don’t quite click. Concepts overlap in ways that aren’t obvious yet.

I’ve accepted that this confusion is part of the process. There isn’t a shortcut around it.

When I get stuck, I use tools like ChatGPT to break concepts down into simpler terms. I ask basic questions without worrying about how they sound:

- What is a React hook, really?
- Why do people reach for Zustand?
- Can I skip hooks and just use a state library?

At first, those questions expose how much I don’t know. But over time, patterns start to emerge. I begin to understand why Zustand isn’t a replacement for hooks, but something that becomes useful when state coordination actually gets difficult—like managing comments, reactions, or cross-cutting concerns in a real application.

That’s when the fundamentals start to matter. Simple state belongs in `useState`. More complex coordination earns a more specialized tool. Learning that distinction has been far more valuable than memorizing any specific API.

## Writing Things Down When Thinking Isn’t Enough

One thing I’ve learned about myself is that understanding doesn’t always happen in my head alone. I need a place to capture confusion, half-formed ideas, and open questions without breaking my flow.

That’s where [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/) fits into my learning process.

I don’t use it to build an elaborate knowledge system. I use it to reduce friction. When something doesn’t make sense, I write it down. When a concept finally clicks, I capture the explanation in my own words. Over time, those notes become a reference—not because they’re perfectly organized, but because they reflect how I actually learned something.

The goal isn’t elegance. It’s continuity.

## What Actually Lasts

Frameworks change. Libraries fall in and out of favor. Syntax evolves. That’s just part of working in this field.

What lasts longer is the ability to learn deliberately:

- to recognize when a problem is simple and when it’s genuinely complex,
- to resist tools that solve problems you don’t have yet,
- and to build on fundamentals instead of replacing them every time something new appears.

As someone who consults full-time while learning development on my own, I’ve found that growth comes less from collecting tools and more from understanding when—and why—to use them. The real leverage isn’t in the framework itself, but in the habits that guide how you approach learning in the first place.
