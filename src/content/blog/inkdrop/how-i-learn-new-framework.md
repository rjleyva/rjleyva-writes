## What Drives Me

Every time a new framework emerges, it shines like a freshly polished tool in a crowded workshop. Its simplicity, elegance, and promise of quick mastery can easily lure beginners like me. I’ve felt that pull, the temptation to dive in headfirst simply because it looks easy to use.

But I’ve learned to pause. Instead of chasing novelty for its own sake, I ask myself: What tangible benefits does this bring? Which problems does it truly solve compared to my current workflow? Why choose this path over another? And—most importantly—when does it make sense for the project I’m building?

This approach turns learning from a superficial sprint into a deliberate, meaningful journey. It’s less about following trends and more about understanding purpose.

## Learning the Patterns

When I dive into a new framework, one of the first things I notice is the syntax—the patterns, the way pieces fit together. As a beginner, logic often feels like a foreign language. I’ve learned that it’s okay to feel lost at the start. That confusion, frustrating as it can be, is also the part that makes the journey thrilling: the puzzle of picking up tiny fragments of information and slowly connecting them into something meaningful.

I’ve accepted that there’s no shortcut. When I get stuck, I turn to ChatGPT, asking it to explain things in beginner-friendly ways, often with analogies I can relate to. I don’t shy away from the “dumb” questions: What is a React hook? Why do some YouTubers use Zustand? Can I skip React hooks and jump straight to Zustand?

Sure, my questions reveal my confusion—but over days, the pieces start to click. I begin to see why Zustand is not a replacement but an essential tool, and why Zustand becomes valuable when managing complex state, like comments and reactions on my blog. Simple tasks like theming still suit useState, but when coordination grows tricky, a tool like Zustand turns chaos into clarity. Slowly, I begin to understand what “complicated” really means in the context of code—and why learning the basics matters before chasing the next shiny tool.

## We Humans Are Not Perfect

Another crucial part of my learning journey is embracing imperfection. I’ve learned that it’s not enough to simply jot down solutions—I need to capture the confusion, the “why” behind each step, and the thoughts that swirl around my head as I try to make sense of it all.

This is where [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/) comes in. It’s a note-taking app that doesn’t distract me, doesn’t pull me away from the flow of learning. Instead, it gives me focus. It allows me to write freely, to explore my thoughts, and to slowly connect the dots at my own pace. Less friction, more space for curiosity—and more time to truly understand.

## The Journey Matters More Than the Tools

At the end of the day, it’s not about the newest framework, the slickest library, or the trendiest tool. It’s about the process—the curiosity, the mistakes, the small victories, and the slow, steady understanding that comes from embracing the unknown.

As a full time Solutions Consultant and self-taught developer, every confusion is a teacher, every “why” is a doorway, and every note I take is a map I can revisit later. The frameworks will change, the syntax will evolve, but the way I learn, reflect, and connect the dots—that is what lasts.

Frameworks change fast. Learning how you learn is the part that compounds.
