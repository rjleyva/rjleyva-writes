At first glance, it looked like\na hydration issue, a delayed theme state update, or even an SVG rendering problem.\nBut after digging deeper, it turned out to be something much simpler.\n\n## The Root Cause\n\nSurprisingly, the issue wasn’t React, the theme toggle, or Vite. I spent way too\nlong checking React DevTools before I thought to look at the CSS. The culprit was\na single line of CSS:\n\n```css\ntransition: all;\n```\n\nBecause the icons used `filter` for coloring, specifying `transition: all` caused\nthe browser to animate every possible property. During the theme change, some of\nthese properties temporarily passed through invalid or intermediate visual states,\nwhich is exactly what caused the flicker.\n\n## The FIX\n\nThe solution was simple once I understood the problem. Instead of transitioning\nevery property, I limited the transition to exactly what I needed. Updating the\nCSS for the social icons to:\n\n```css\n.socials__icon {\n  /* Transition only filter to prevent unwanted flickers */\n  transition: filter var(--transition-duration-normal);\n  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0 transparent);\n}\n```\n\nOnce I changed:\n\n```css\ntransition: all;\n```\n\nto:\n\n```css\ntransition: filter;\n```\n\nThe flicker disappeared entirely.\n\nNo JavaScript changes.\nNo theme logic changes.\nJust a scoped transition.\n\n# A Lesson in transition: all\n\n> `transition: all` is convenient — but often dangerous.\n\nThis experience reinforced an easy-to-forget rule. Animating all properties can\ncause unintended visual glitches during state changes, trigger strange\nintermediate render states, and make bugs harder to reason about. Explicitly\ntargeting only the properties that need animation is safer, more predictable, and\nprevents subtle UI regressions.\n\nThis small bug reminded me that some of the most valuable lessons come from tiny,\nalmost invisible issues. It wasn’t about performance, complex architecture, or\nadvanced animations. It was about paying attention to the details. I'd been\ncareless with `transition: all` because it was quick and seemed harmless, but\nthat one line caused a subtle visual glitch that took way too long to track down.\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nBe intentional with transitions. Target only the properties you need to animate\nand avoid `transition: all` unless you really mean it. This prevents subtle\nvisual glitches and makes your UI more predictable.\n",

    "content": "\n# Finding Zen in My Terminal\n\nI spend most of my day in the terminal. At first, I didn’t notice the small UI\ndetails that quietly distracted me—tab bars, window chrome, slight background\nclutter. Over time, I realized these little things were adding noise and making\nlong coding sessions more tiring than they needed to be.\n\nThis is the story of how I stripped my terminal down to just what I need,\ncreating a setup that lets me focus for hours without friction.\n\n> This isn’t a “best practices” guide. It’s just what works for me.\n\n## Saying Goodbye to the Tab Bar\n\nOnce I leaned on TMUX for splits and layouts, the tab bar became redundant. I\nturned it off:\n\n```lua\nenable_tab_bar = false\n```\n\nIt was like decluttering my desk. Suddenly, there was nothing in my way but the\ntext.\n\n## Minimal but Practical\n\nI also wanted to keep the window frame minimal but practical. I don’t need full\nwindow chrome, just enough to resize the terminal when I need it:\n\n```lua\nwindow_decorations = \"RESIZE\"\n```\n\n## A Subtle Blur for Separation (macOS)\n\nOn macOS, I added a subtle blur behind the terminal. I experimented with\ntransparency and different blur levels until I landed on something gentle:\n\n```lua\nmacos_window_background_blur = 10\n```\n\nIt gives a slight separation from the desktop without making the text fuzzy—just\nenough breathing room to reduce eye fatigue.\n\n## Full Opacity for Comfort\n\nI used to play with transparency, but in the end, full opacity won. The text\nfeels more consistent and easier on the eyes:\n\n```lua\nwindow_background_opacity = 1.0\n```\n\n## Choosing a Font That Works\n\nFonts are surprisingly important. I went with Lilex Nerd Font because it’s\nreadable and has great glyph coverage. I also bumped the size up—comfort over\ncramming as many lines as possible:\n\n```lua\nfont = wezterm.font_with_fallback({ \"Lilex Nerd Font\" })\nfont_size = 18\n```\n\n## Scrollback That Actually Works\n\nScrollback is another small tweak that makes a big difference. A deeper buffer\nmeans I can review long logs or retrace commands without frustration:\n\n```lua\nscrollback_lines = 10000\n```\n\n## Colors That Don’t Tire Your Eyes\n\nFinally, colors. I use the solarized-osaka palette because it’s easy on the eyes\nfor long sessions. Nothing flashy, nothing harsh:\n\n```lua\ncolors = {\n  foreground = \"#839395\",\n  background = \"#001419\",\n\n  cursor_bg = \"#839395\",\n  cursor_border = \"#839395\",\n  cursor_fg = \"#001419\",\n\n  selection_bg = \"#1a6397\",\n  selection_fg = \"#839395\",\n\n  ansi = {\n    \"#001014\",\n    \"#db302d\",\n    \"#849900\",\n    \"#b28500\",\n    \"#268bd3\",\n    \"#d23681\",\n    \"#29a298\",\n    \"#9eabac\",\n  },\n\n  brights = {\n    \"#001419\",\n    \"#db302d\",\n    \"#849900\",\n    \"#b28500\",\n    \"#268bd3\",\n    \"#d23681\",\n    \"#29a298\",\n    \"#839395\",\n  },\n},\n```\n\n## The Full Zen Configuration\n\n```lua\nlocal wezterm = require(\"wezterm\")\n\nlocal M = {}\n\nM.spec = {\n  enable_tab_bar = false,\n  window_decorations = \"RESIZE\",\n  window_background_opacity = 1.0,\n  macos_window_background_blur = 10,\n  font = wezterm.font_with_fallback({ \"Lilex Nerd Font\" }),\n  font_size = 18,\n  scrollback_lines = 10000,\n\n  colors = {\n    foreground = \"#839395\",\n    background = \"#001419\",\n\n    cursor_bg = \"#839395\",\n    cursor_border = \"#839395\",\n    cursor_fg = \"#001419\",\n\n    selection_bg = \"#1a6397\",\n    selection_fg = \"#839395\",\n\n    ansi = {\n      \"#001014\",\n      \"#db302d\",\n      \"#849900\",\n      \"#b28500\",\n      \"#268bd3\",\n      \"#d23681\",\n      \"#29a298\",\n      \"#9eabac\",\n    },\n\n    brights = {\n      \"#001419\",\n      \"#db302d\",\n      \"#849900\",\n      \"#b28500\",\n      \"#268bd3\",\n      \"#d23681\",\n      \"#29a298\",\n      \"#839395\",\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nreturn M.spec\n```\n\nOver time, I realized that small adjustments—fonts, colors, scrollback, even\nsubtle blur—compound in impact. Each tweak reduces friction, letting the terminal\nfade into the background so I can focus on code.\n\nThis setup is my “zen mode.” It’s not perfect and it will probably evolve, but\nfor now, it transforms the terminal from a tool I wrestle with into a space I can\ninhabit for hours, fully immersed in work.\n",
