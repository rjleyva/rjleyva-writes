At first glance, it looked like\na hydration issue, a delayed theme state update, or even an SVG rendering problem.\nBut after digging deeper, it turned out to be something much simpler.\n\n## The Root Cause\n\nSurprisingly, the issue wasn’t React, the theme toggle, or Vite. I spent way too\nlong checking React DevTools before I thought to look at the CSS. The culprit was\na single line of CSS:\n\n```css\ntransition: all;\n```\n\nBecause the icons used `filter` for coloring, specifying `transition: all` caused\nthe browser to animate every possible property. During the theme change, some of\nthese properties temporarily passed through invalid or intermediate visual states,\nwhich is exactly what caused the flicker.\n\n## The FIX\n\nThe solution was simple once I understood the problem. Instead of transitioning\nevery property, I limited the transition to exactly what I needed. Updating the\nCSS for the social icons to:\n\n```css\n.socials__icon {\n  /* Transition only filter to prevent unwanted flickers */\n  transition: filter var(--transition-duration-normal);\n  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0 transparent);\n}\n```\n\nOnce I changed:\n\n```css\ntransition: all;\n```\n\nto:\n\n```css\ntransition: filter;\n```\n\nThe flicker disappeared entirely.\n\nNo JavaScript changes.\nNo theme logic changes.\nJust a scoped transition.\n\n# A Lesson in transition: all\n\n> `transition: all` is convenient — but often dangerous.\n\nThis experience reinforced an easy-to-forget rule. Animating all properties can\ncause unintended visual glitches during state changes, trigger strange\nintermediate render states, and make bugs harder to reason about. Explicitly\ntargeting only the properties that need animation is safer, more predictable, and\nprevents subtle UI regressions.\n\nThis small bug reminded me that some of the most valuable lessons come from tiny,\nalmost invisible issues. It wasn’t about performance, complex architecture, or\nadvanced animations. It was about paying attention to the details. I'd been\ncareless with `transition: all` because it was quick and seemed harmless, but\nthat one line caused a subtle visual glitch that took way too long to track down.\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nBe intentional with transitions. Target only the properties you need to animate\nand avoid `transition: all` unless you really mean it. This prevents subtle\nvisual glitches and makes your UI more predictable.\n",

    "content": "\nNeovim 0.11 (released March 2025) introduced a simpler, fully native way to configure the Language Server Protocol (LSP). With this release, LSP becomes a true first-class citizen—no extra plugins required for basic setup.\n\nYou can still use Mason, a Neovim plugin that acts as a portable package manager for external development tooling such as LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters.\n\n> NOTE: Mason itself does not configure the LSP servers for use in Neovim. It just installs and manages the binaries/tools. To wire them up with Neovim built-in LSP client, you can use mason-lspconfig.nvim together with nvim-lspconfig.\n\nWhat we’ll cover today is a more manual approach. It requires installing LSP servers—such as lua-language-server—directly on your machine. This approach isn’t portable. You’ll need to reinstall the server when setting up a new machine, or automate it with a shell [script](https://github.com/rjleyva/dotfiles-macos/blob/main/scripts/dev-setup.sh).\n\nLet's begin with installing `lua-language-server` via homebrew:\n\n```bash\nbrew install lua-language-server\n```\n\n> NOTE: You can also install this via npm but I prefer to use homebrew for this instance.\n\n### Structure Overview\n\nThe structure is based on [Marco Peluso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdhxpn1XdjQ) YouTube video.\n\n```bash\nnvim/\n├── init.lua\n├── lsp/\n│   └── lua_ls.lua\n└── lua/\n    └── core/\n        └── lsp.lua\n```\n\n`lsp/` contains server specifications only, while `lua/core/` is responsible for enabling and orchestrating them. This keeps configuration declarative and avoids coupling server definitions to startup logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup\n\nLet’s start by creating the `nvim` directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/nvim\n```\n\nThen move to the `nvim` directory by running this command:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.config/nvim\n```\n\nCreate the main `init.lua` file:\n\n```bash\nnvim init.lua\n```\n\nand add this configuration:\n\n```lua\nrequire('core.lsp')\n```\n\nNow let's create the `lsp` directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir lsp\n```\n\nThen move to `lsp` directory by running this command:\n\n```bash\ncd lsp\n```\n\nCreate `lua_ls.lua` by running this command:\n\n```bash\nnvim lua_ls.lua\n```\n\nThen add this to `lua_ls.lua`:\n\n```lua\nlocal M = {}\n\nM.spec = {\n  cmd = {\n    'lua-language-server',\n  },\n\n  filetypes = {\n    'lua',\n  },\n\n  root_markers = {\n    '.git',\n    '.luacheckrc',\n    '.luarc.json',\n    '.luarc.jsonc',\n    '.stylua.toml',\n    'selene.toml',\n    'selene.yml',\n  },\n\n  settings = {\n    Lua = {\n      runtime = {\n        version = 'LuaJIT',\n      },\n      diagnostics = {\n        globals = { 'vim' },\n      },\n      hint = {\n        enable = true,\n        setType = true,\n        paramType = true,\n        -- paramName = 'All',\n        -- semicolon = 'All',\n        -- arrayIndex = 'All',\n        -- moduleName = 'All',\n      },\n      telemetry = {\n        enable = false,\n      },\n      workspace = {\n        checkThirdParty = false,\n        library = {},\n        -- Enable if you want:\n        -- Full API docs and completion for plugin development\n        -- Autocompletion for all vim.api.* functions\n        -- Uncomment the line below to index Neovim’s runtime and plugins:\n        -- library = vim.api.nvim_get_runtime_file(),\n      },\n    },\n  },\n\n  single_file_support = true,\n  autostart = false, -- manually enabled via vim.lsp.enable\n  log_level = vim.lsp.protocol.MessageType.Warning,\n}\n\nM.name = 'lua_ls'\n\nreturn M.spec\n```\n\n> NOTE: These markers define how a project root is detected. This becomes useful once you start managing multiple language servers consistently.\n\nGo back to `nvim` directory by running this command:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.config/nvim\n```\n\nThen create `lua` and `core` directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p lua/core/\n```\n\nThen move inside `core` directory:\n\n```bash\ncd lua/core/\n```\n\nand create `lsp.lua`:\n\n```bash\nnvim lsp.lua\n```\n\nThen enable it using `vim.lsp.enable` like this:\n\nThis explicitly enables the Lua language server by name:\n\n```lua\nvim.lsp.enable({\n  'lua_ls',\n})\n```\n\n> NOTE: `vim.lsp.enable()` is available starting in Neovim 0.11 and replaces the need for `nvim-lspconfig` in simple setups.\n> This approach works well for most setups, but more complex workflows may still benefit from `lspconfig` or Mason integrations.\n\nInside Neovim you can run:\n\n```\ncheckhealth lsp\n```\n\nand you'll see something like this:\n\n```\nvim.lsp: Active Clients ~\n- lua_ls (id: 1)\n  - Version: 3.15.0\n  - Root directory: ~/dotfiles-macos\n  - Command: { \"lua-language-server\" }\n  - Settings: {\n      Lua = {\n        diagnostics = {\n          globals = { \"vim\" }\n        },\n        hint = {\n          enable = true,\n          paramType = true,\n          setType = true\n        },\n        runtime = {\n          version = \"LuaJIT\"\n        },\n        telemetry = {\n          enable = false\n        },\n        workspace = {\n          checkThirdParty = false,\n          library = {}\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  - Attached buffers: 2, 3\n```\n\nThis output confirms that `lua_ls` is running successfully.\n\nThis setup is what I currently use daily in my Neovim workflow.\n\n### Why use native LSP in Neovim 0.11+?\n\nMy main reason for choosing this approach is simple: fewer plugins to maintain, faster startup times, and easier debugging. While manually configuring LSP takes a bit more effort, it taught me a lot about what’s actually happening behind the scenes. I’m in control of everything, and each configuration exists because I need it—not because a plugin decided for me.\n\n### Who is this for?\n\nThis setup is ideal if you:\n\n- Use Neovim 0.11+\n- Want fewer plugins and more control\n- Prefer understanding how LSP works under the hood\n\nIf you want a fully portable, zero-setup experience, Mason may still be a better fit.\n\nThis approach scales naturally as you add more language servers. In future posts, I’ll cover keymaps, diagnostics, formatting, and multi-server setups—still using Neovim’s native LSP.\n\nYou can find the full working Neovim configuration [here](https://github.com/rjleyva/dotfiles-macos).\n\n### Next steps\n\n- Add more language servers using the same `lsp/` pattern\n- Define LSP keymaps and diagnostics\n- Integrate formatting without external plugins\n\nSee you in the next post.\n",

    "content": "\n# Finding Zen in My Terminal\n\nI spend most of my day in the terminal. At first, I didn’t notice the small UI\ndetails that quietly distracted me—tab bars, window chrome, slight background\nclutter. Over time, I realized these little things were adding noise and making\nlong coding sessions more tiring than they needed to be.\n\nThis is the story of how I stripped my terminal down to just what I need,\ncreating a setup that lets me focus for hours without friction.\n\n> This isn’t a “best practices” guide. It’s just what works for me.\n\n## Saying Goodbye to the Tab Bar\n\nOnce I leaned on TMUX for splits and layouts, the tab bar became redundant. I\nturned it off:\n\n```lua\nenable_tab_bar = false\n```\n\nIt was like decluttering my desk. Suddenly, there was nothing in my way but the\ntext.\n\n## Minimal but Practical\n\nI also wanted to keep the window frame minimal but practical. I don’t need full\nwindow chrome, just enough to resize the terminal when I need it:\n\n```lua\nwindow_decorations = \"RESIZE\"\n```\n\n## A Subtle Blur for Separation (macOS)\n\nOn macOS, I added a subtle blur behind the terminal. I experimented with\ntransparency and different blur levels until I landed on something gentle:\n\n```lua\nmacos_window_background_blur = 10\n```\n\nIt gives a slight separation from the desktop without making the text fuzzy—just\nenough breathing room to reduce eye fatigue.\n\n## Full Opacity for Comfort\n\nI used to play with transparency, but in the end, full opacity won. The text\nfeels more consistent and easier on the eyes:\n\n```lua\nwindow_background_opacity = 1.0\n```\n\n## Choosing a Font That Works\n\nFonts are surprisingly important. I went with Lilex Nerd Font because it’s\nreadable and has great glyph coverage. I also bumped the size up—comfort over\ncramming as many lines as possible:\n\n```lua\nfont = wezterm.font_with_fallback({ \"Lilex Nerd Font\" })\nfont_size = 18\n```\n\n## Scrollback That Actually Works\n\nScrollback is another small tweak that makes a big difference. A deeper buffer\nmeans I can review long logs or retrace commands without frustration:\n\n```lua\nscrollback_lines = 10000\n```\n\n## Colors That Don’t Tire Your Eyes\n\nFinally, colors. I use the solarized-osaka palette because it’s easy on the eyes\nfor long sessions. Nothing flashy, nothing harsh:\n\n```lua\ncolors = {\n  foreground = \"#839395\",\n  background = \"#001419\",\n\n  cursor_bg = \"#839395\",\n  cursor_border = \"#839395\",\n  cursor_fg = \"#001419\",\n\n  selection_bg = \"#1a6397\",\n  selection_fg = \"#839395\",\n\n  ansi = {\n    \"#001014\",\n    \"#db302d\",\n    \"#849900\",\n    \"#b28500\",\n    \"#268bd3\",\n    \"#d23681\",\n    \"#29a298\",\n    \"#9eabac\",\n  },\n\n  brights = {\n    \"#001419\",\n    \"#db302d\",\n    \"#849900\",\n    \"#b28500\",\n    \"#268bd3\",\n    \"#d23681\",\n    \"#29a298\",\n    \"#839395\",\n  },\n},\n```\n\n## The Full Zen Configuration\n\n```lua\nlocal wezterm = require(\"wezterm\")\n\nlocal M = {}\n\nM.spec = {\n  enable_tab_bar = false,\n  window_decorations = \"RESIZE\",\n  window_background_opacity = 1.0,\n  macos_window_background_blur = 10,\n  font = wezterm.font_with_fallback({ \"Lilex Nerd Font\" }),\n  font_size = 18,\n  scrollback_lines = 10000,\n\n  colors = {\n    foreground = \"#839395\",\n    background = \"#001419\",\n\n    cursor_bg = \"#839395\",\n    cursor_border = \"#839395\",\n    cursor_fg = \"#001419\",\n\n    selection_bg = \"#1a6397\",\n    selection_fg = \"#839395\",\n\n    ansi = {\n      \"#001014\",\n      \"#db302d\",\n      \"#849900\",\n      \"#b28500\",\n      \"#268bd3\",\n      \"#d23681\",\n      \"#29a298\",\n      \"#9eabac\",\n    },\n\n    brights = {\n      \"#001419\",\n      \"#db302d\",\n      \"#849900\",\n      \"#b28500\",\n      \"#268bd3\",\n      \"#d23681\",\n      \"#29a298\",\n      \"#839395\",\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nreturn M.spec\n```\n\nOver time, I realized that small adjustments—fonts, colors, scrollback, even\nsubtle blur—compound in impact. Each tweak reduces friction, letting the terminal\nfade into the background so I can focus on code.\n\nThis setup is my “zen mode.” It’s not perfect and it will probably evolve, but\nfor now, it transforms the terminal from a tool I wrestle with into a space I can\ninhabit for hours, fully immersed in work.\n",
